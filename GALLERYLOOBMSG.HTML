<p  align="justify">As I've mentioned, I do like the nature so much, from the its scenic view up to the vibe it gave to the person is very much
an inspiration inducing to me. Whenever I'm close with nature, all I could think is to lay down and daydream. Even though, green isn't
my favorite color, this color of nature is remarkable for its calming sense that could make anyone's mind be in harmony.
