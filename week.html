<h1 align="center"> Highlight of my week  </h1>

<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<blockquote>
In college context, monday is usually the day in which most of the students don't want to come but 
here I am again ready to face the prelim exams, well I did study and I hope I pass my exams (fingers crossed)
</blockquote>

<br>

<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
<blockquote>I spent all day studying and I slept for only 3 hours. As I've expected, this became a really tiring day. Well 
I have to really get used to it :) </blockquote>

<br>

<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
<blockquote> I was really anticipating this day because of two reasons: (1) Last day of prelim exams (2) NARUTO RUN! 
Because why not, I remember during my playtime with my friends years ago, we always do this ninja run. Unfortunately 
it was interrupted by the school officials. Despite of that happenings, I really enjoyed my wednesday! </blockquote>
<p> Here's a gif of mine about what happened to the lucky few ninjas! </p>

 <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
 <blockquote> If you're reading this, you can suppose that I am typing this today. 
 I went to out to meet my highschool squad and my day became a lot better with them, we have this sworn regular meet-up because
 we don't want to lose connection with each other which is really nice for we already reaced the 5th year of friendship mark!
