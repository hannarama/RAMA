<p align= "center" style="color:#6c486e"> <font size="+3"> <strong> Hi! I'm Hanna </strong> </font> </p>
<p align= "center"> Welcome to my second home! &#10047;</p>
<p align="center"> This is my grandmother's house, I'm currently living here because it is just 15 minutes away to my dear University.</p>

<p>Let me guide you through this virtual tour:</p>
<p>&#10047; <strong>The front yard</strong>, where you can see my lola's mini store and my cousin's motorshop (closed) </p>
<p>&#10047; <strong>The living room</strong>, wherein I spent most of my nap time on that long blue sofa whenever I come home from school</p>
<p>&#10047; <strong>The stairs</strong>, I don't usually stay here because I'm really scared of this part of the house</p>
<p>&#10047; <strong>The hallway</strong>, this is where I always do my nails and take a picture because of the good lighting of the place</p>
<p>&#10047; <strong>The terrace</strong>, I'm an avid fan of milk teas and coffees, this is the place where I usually drink them while reading a newspaper or a book.</p>
